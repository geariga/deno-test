        <h1>H₂O - Water</h1>

        <p>Water, represented by the chemical formula H₂O, is a vital substance for all forms of life on Earth. It consists of two hydrogen atoms (H) bonded to one oxygen atom (O), forming a molecule.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Structure of Water</h2>
        <p>The structure of a water molecule consists of a bent shape, with the angle between the two hydrogen atoms being approximately 104.5 degrees. This gives water unique properties such as surface tension and its ability to dissolve many substances.</p>

        <h2>Properties of Water</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Water is a universal solvent, meaning it can dissolve many substances.</li>
            <li>It has a high specific heat, which helps regulate temperature.</li>
            <li>Water expands when it freezes, which is why ice floats on water.</li>
            <li>It is essential for many biological processes, such as respiration and photosynthesis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of oceans, lakes, and rivers. It is also present in the atmosphere as vapor and in glaciers as ice.</p>
